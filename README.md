# JLang
<h3> Author-Prerit Gautam </h3>
<br>
A highlevel programming language made in java<br>
Its syntax is very similar to that of Java. It is a JVM based language.
Here is a an example source code:<br>
String x$="100"&<br>s
String is used to indicate the data type of variable, $ is a deliminator used to indicate that a new variable is being declared and & marks the end of value to be assigned for a variable.
<br>

# Expected Stages for the compiler:
i.) Lexical Analayser
<br>
ii.) Syntax Analayser
<br>
iii.) JVM Code generator
<br>

JLang will convert the .j source file into intermediate code for the JVM which will be fed into it to be executed.
<br>
To use JLang, clone the repository into local machine and then go to src/src/Lexer/LexicalAnalayser then run it.
<br>
For now, only the Lexical Analyser is available.
